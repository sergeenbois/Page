            Football has been a lifelong passion for me, both as a player and a fan. I actively play and follow the sport, with a special connection to the French national team and my club, Olympique Lyonnais (OL). 
            I spend hours watching the beautiful game, analyzing tactics and enjoying the thrill of every match.

        <p>
            While football is my main sport, I also enjoy volleyball and tennis. The excitement of the game, the intensity of competition, and the strategic thinking behind each play are aspects I deeply appreciate. 
            Additionally, I love watching rugby and various other sports, especially during major events like the World Cup, the Olympics, and the Tour de France.
