        <h2>Sociology</h2>
        <p>
            Understanding society through the lens of Bourdieu's "habitus," Marx's class conflict, and Weber's cultural analysis fascinates me. 
            The interplay between sociology and economics offers profound insights into human behavior.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Key Figures: Bourdieu, Weber, Durkheim, Marx, Engels</li>
            <li>Favorite Concepts: Cultural capital, class struggles, and societal structures.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Economics</h2>
        <p>
            Economics blends rational analysis with societal impact. From Keynes’ revolutionary ideas to Duflo's econometrics, it’s a domain that shapes the world. 
            Game theory and decision-making particularly resonate with me.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Influential Economists: Keynes, Marx, Schumpeter, Duflo, Piketty, Tirole, Julia Cagé</li>
            <li>Favorite Topics: Econometrics, macro/microeconomics, game theory, and finance.</li>
