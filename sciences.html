            <h2>üî¢ Mathematics</h2>
            <p>
                Mathematics is the language of the universe, a tool to unravel the mysteries of existence. 
                Whether it‚Äôs the elegance of Euler's formulas, the infinite complexity of topology, or the predictive power of statistical models, 
                math is a cornerstone of human understanding. 
                I am particularly drawn to its abstract beauty and real-world applications.

            <h2>üåå Physics</h2>
            <p>
                Physics is a quest to understand the fundamental laws that govern our universe. 
                From Einstein's relativity to the quantum world of Bohr and Planck, this field continues to redefine what we know about reality. 
                I am captivated by astronomy's vast expanse, quantum mechanics‚Äô counterintuitive phenomena, and the elegance of theoretical physics.

            <h2>üß¨ Biology</h2>
            <p>
                Biology reveals the intricate web of life on Earth, from the smallest cellular mechanisms to entire ecosystems. 
                I am fascinated by how evolution shapes species, how the human brain functions, and how genetics opens doors to new medical breakthroughs. 
                This field inspires hope for understanding life at its deepest levels.

            <h2>üíª Computer Science</h2>
            <p>
                Computer science is at the heart of modern innovation. 
                From Turing's pioneering work on computation to today's advancements in AI and quantum computing, 
                it‚Äôs a discipline that combines logic with creativity. 
                I am deeply intrigued by cryptography, the binary foundations of computers, and the limitless potential of AI systems.
            </p>

            <h2>üåç Sociology</h2>
            <p>
                Sociology helps us understand the fabric of human society. 
                Through concepts like Bourdieu's *habitus* or Marx's class conflict, 
                it unveils how culture, power, and history shape our world. 
                I am particularly drawn to the intersection of sociology and economics, where human behavior meets structural forces.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Influential Thinkers:</strong> Bourdieu, Weber, Durkheim, Marx, Engels</li>
                <li><strong>Key Concepts:</strong> Cultural capital, class struggles, social structures, and the sociology of power.</li>

            <h2>üí∞ Economics</h2>
            <p>
                Economics is the science of decision-making, where abstract theories have tangible impacts on people‚Äôs lives. 
                From Keynes‚Äô groundbreaking ideas to the nuanced econometrics of Duflo, I love exploring how data and models shape our understanding of markets, societies, and policies. 
                Game theory, macroeconomics, and finance are areas I find particularly engaging.
